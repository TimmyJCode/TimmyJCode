- Hello, world! I'm Jack, a computer science undergraduate student at Portland State University.
  
- My interests include software development, video games, weightlifting, and sports (go 49ers, Giants, and Sharks!)
  
- I'm currently learning different programming methods- particularly object oriented and functional programming in C++.
  
- In my time studying computer science/programming, I have gained experience with C++, C, Python, Linux, Git, GDB, and more!
  
- My current personal project is a web scraper built in Python that will collect the records and statistics of UFC fighters, allowing for comparisons to be made between
  fighters to assist viewers understanding each althlete's strengths/weaknesses, in order to help them predict the winner of a given future matchup.
  
- The best way to reach me is via email, at jackt@pdx.edu

- My dream is to one day assist in the creation of software to assist aviators, both manned and unmanned, in flight planning, fuel calculations, and
  crew management. My time in the military filled me with a fascination for the aviation industry, and the challenges/complexity that come with
  attempting to coordinate aircraft in congested airspace.
